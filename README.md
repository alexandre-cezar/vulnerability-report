# **Vulnerability Report Automation**

This application automates the process of fetching vulnerability data from the Prisma Cloud API, storing the daily data in an Excel spreadsheet, and summarizing the monthly data.
The script ensures that a new sheet is created for each day and a summary sheet is updated with daily data. A new spreadsheet is created at the start of each new month.

## **Features**
- **Daily Data Collection**: Fetches vulnerability data from the Prisma Cloud API and stores it in a daily sheet.
- **Monthly Summary**: Summarizes the daily data in a summary sheet.
- **Monthly Spreadsheet**: Creates a new spreadsheet at the start of each new month.
- **Logging**: Logs the execution status to a daily log file.

## **Prerequisites**
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (probably works on any Linux/Debian flavor)
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `openpyxl`
- Prisma Cloud API credentials (customerName, access key, prismaId, secret key)

## **Installation**
- Clone the repository:
  git clone "repository-url"
- Move to the repository folder:
  cd "repository-directory"

- Install required Python packages:
  pip install requests openpyxl

## **Configuration**
- Update the authenticate function in the program with your Prisma Cloud API stack and proper Prisma Cloud API credentials.
- Update the main function in the program with the Prisma Cloud API stack.
- Set up a daily cronjob to run the program.

## **Output**
See the example spreadsheet for an idea of how the data is published.

## **Note**
This code is provided as-is, without any commitments for support and updates.
